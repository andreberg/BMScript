 * @mainpage BMScript: Harness The Power Of Shell Scripts
 * <hr>
 * @par Introduction
 *
 * BMScript is an Objective-C class set to make it easier to utilize the
 * power and flexibility of a whole range of scripting languages that already
 * come with modern Macs. BMScript does not favor any particular scripting
 * language or UNIXâ„¢ command line tool for that matter, instead it was written
 * as an abstraction layer to NSTask, and as such supports any command line tool,
 * provided that it is available on the target system.
 *
 * @par Usage
 *
 * BMScript can be used in two ways:
 *
 * -# Use it directly
 * -# Guided by the BMScriptLanguageProtocol, make a subclass from it
 *
 * The easiest way to use BMScript is, of course, to instanciate it directly:
 *
 * @include bmScriptCreationMethods.m
 *
 * You typically use the designated initializer for which you supply the script
 * source and script options yourself.<br>
 * The options dictionary then looks like this:
 *
 * @include bmScriptOptionsDictionary.m
 *
 * There's two constant keys. These are the only keys you need to define values for.
 * #BMScriptOptionsTaskLaunchPathKey stores the path to the tool's executable and
 * #BMScriptOptionsTaskArgumentsKey is a nil-terminated variable list of parameters
 * to be used as arguments to the task which will load and execute the tool found at
 * the launch path specified for the other key.
 *
 * It is very important to note that the script source string should <b>NOT</b> be
 * supplied in the array for the #BMScriptOptionsTaskArgumentsKey, as it will be added
 * later by the class after performing tests and delegation which could alter the script
 * in ways needed to safely execute it. This is in the delegate object's responsibility.
 *
 * A macro function called #BMSynthesizeOptions(path, args) is available to ease
 * the declaration of the options.<br>
 * Here is the definition:
 *
 * @include bmScriptSynthesizeOptions.m
 *
 * <div class="box important">
 *      <div class="table">
 *          <div class="row">
 *              <div class="label cell">Important:</div>
 *              <div class="message cell">
 *                  Don't forget the <b>nil</b> at the end even
 *                  if you don't need to supply any task arguments.
 *              </div>
 *          </div>
 *      </div>
 * </div>
 *
 * If you initialize BMScript directly without specifying options and script source
 * (e.g. using <span class="sourcecode">[[%BMScript alloc] init]</span>) the options
 * will default to <span class="sourcecode">BMSynthesizeOptions(@"/bin/echo", @"")</span>
 * and the script source will default to <span class="sourcecode">@"'<script source placeholder>'"</span>.
 *
 * <div class="box warning">
 *      <div class="table">
 *          <div class="row">
 *              <div class="label cell">Warning:</div>
 *              <div class="message cell">
 *                  If you let your end-users, the consumers of your application, supply the
 *                  script source without defining exact task options this can be very dangerous as anything
 *                  passed to <span class="sourcecode">/bin/echo</span> is not checked by default! This is a
 *                  good reason to use the BMScriptDelegateProtocol methods for error/security checking or to
 *                  subclass BMScript instead of using it directly.
 *              </div>
 *          </div>
 *      </div>
 *  </div>
 *
 * There are also convenience methods for the most common scripting languages, which have
 * their options set to OS default values:
 *
 * @include bmScriptConvenienceMethods.m
 *
 * As you can see loading scripts from source files is also supported, including a small
 * and lightweight template system.
 *
 * @par Templates
 *
 * Using templates can be a good way to add domain-specific problem solving to a class.
 * To utilize the template system, three steps are required:
 *
 *   -# Initialize a BMScript instance with a template
 *   -# Saturate template with values ("fill in the blanks")
 *   -# Execute BMScript instance
 *
 * Here are the methods you use to saturate a BMScript template with values:
 *
 * @include bmScriptSaturateTemplate.m
 *
 * So how does a template look like then? We use standard text files which have special
 * token strings bound to get replaced. If you are familiar with Ruby, the magic template token
 * looks a lot like Ruby's double quoted string literal:
 *
 * @verbatim %{} @endverbatim
 *
 * If this pattern structure is empty it will be replaced in the order of occurrence. The first
 * two saturate methods are good for this.
 * If the magic tokens wrap other values, a more flexible dictionary based system can be used
 * with the third saturate method. There, the magic tokens must wrap names of keys defined in the
 * dictionary. The keys will correspond to what the replacement value will be. <br>
 *
 * Here is an example of a Ruby script template, which converts octal or hexadecimal values to their decimal representation:
 *
 * @include convertToDecimalTemplate.rb
 *
 * Here's a short example how you'd use keyword based templates:
 *
 * @include TemplateKeywordSaturationExample.m
 *
 * @par Subclassing BMScript
 *
 * You can also see BMScript as a sort of abstract superclass and customize its
 * behaviour by making a subclass which knows about the details of the particular
 * command line tool that you want to use. Your subclass must implement the
 * BMScriptLanguageProtocol. It only has one required and one optional method:
 *
 * @include bmScriptLanguageProtocol.m
 *
 * The first method should return default values, e.g. for launch path and task arguments,
 * which are sensible and specific to the command line tool your subclass wants to utilize.
 * Here you may again use #BMSynthesizeOptions(path, args) as the options dictionary has the
 * same format as shown above.
 *
 * The second (optional) method should provide a default script source containing commands to execute
 * by the command line tool. If you do not implement this method the script source will be set
 * to the default script source of BMScript (see above).
 *
 * If you subclass BMScript and do not use the designated initializer through which
 * you supply options and script source yourself, the BMScriptLanguageProtocol-p.defaultOptionsForLanguage
 * method will be called on your subclass. If it is missing an exception of type
 * #BMScriptLanguageProtocolMethodMissingException is thrown.
 *
 * @par Execution
 *
 * After you have obtained and configured a BMScript instance, you need to tell it to execute.
 * This can be done by telling it to excute synchroneously (blocking), or asynchroneously (non-blocking):
 *
 * @include bmScriptExecution.m
 *
 * Using the blocking execution model you can either pass a pointer to NSString where the result will be
 * written to (including NSError if needed), or just use plain BMScript.execute. 
 * This will return the TerminationStatus, or the return value the underlying process exited with.
 * You can then obtain the script execution result by accessing BMScript.lastResult.
 *
 * The non-blocking execution model works by means of <a href="http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CocoaFundamentals/CommunicatingWithObjects/CommunicateWithObjects.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH7-SW7" class="external">notifications</a>.
 * You register your class as observer with the default notification center for a notification called
 * #BMScriptTaskDidEndNotification passing a selector to execute once the notification arrives. If you have
 * multiple BMScript instances you can also pass the instance you want to register the notification for as
 * the object paramater (see inline example below).
 *
 * Then you tell the BMScript instance to BMScript.executeInBackgroundAndNotify. When execution finishes and your
 * selector is called it will be passed an NSNotification object which encapsulates an NSDictionary with two keys:
 *
 * <div class="box hasRows noshadow">
 *      <div class="row odd firstRow">
 *          <span class="cell left firstCell">#BMScriptNotificationTaskResults</span>
 *          <span class="cell rightCell lastCell">contains the results returned by the execution as NSString.</span>
 *      </div>
 *      <div class="row even">
 *          <span class="cell left firstCell">#BMScriptNotificationTaskTerminationStatus</span>
 *          <span class="cell rightCell lastCell">contains the termination status (aka return/exit code)</span>
 *      </div>
 * </div>
 *
 * To make that clearer here's an example with the relevant parts thrown together:
 *
 * @include NonBlockingExecutionExample.m
 *
 * It is important to note at this point that the blocking and non-blocking tasks are tracked by seperate instance variables.
 * This was done to minimize the risk of race conditions when BMScript would be used in a multi-threaded environment.
 *
 * @par On The Topic Of Concurrency
 *
 * All access to global data, shared variables and mutable objects has been
 * locked with <a href="x-man-page://pthread" class="external">pthread_mutex_locks</a>
 * (in Xcode: right-click and choose "Open Link in Browser").
 * This is done by a macro wrapper which will avaluate to nothing if #BMSCRIPT_THREAD_SAFE is not 1.
 * #BMSCRIPT_THREAD_SAFE will also set #BM_ATOMIC to 1 which will make all accessor methods atomic.
 * Note that there haven't been enough tests yet to say that BMScript is thread-safe. 
 *
 * It is likely thread-safe enough, but still, care has to be taken when two different threads want to access
 * internal state of the same BMScript instance. 
 *
 * BMScript was also designed such that re-use is possible. Unfortunately this does not automatically mean it's 
 * intrinsically thread-safe or that it does promote re-entrant code. 
 * You are encouraged to look through the source in order to determine if it may be thread-safe enough for your purpose.
 *
 * @par Delegate Methods
 *
 * BMScript also features a delegate protocol (BMScriptDelegateProtocol) providing descriptions for methods
 * your subclass or another class posing as delegate can implement:
 *
 * @include bmScriptDelegateMethods.m
 *
 * @par Instance Local Execution History
 *
 * And last but not least, BMScript features an execution cache, called its history. This works like the Shell history
 * in that it will keep script sources as well as the results of the execution of those sources.
 * To access the history you may use the following methods:
 *
 * @include bmScriptHistory.m
 *

/*!
 * @example SubclassingExample.m
 *
 * Example of subclassing BMScript.
 *
 * This subclass provides specifics about executing Ruby scripts.
 * Of course this example is a bit of a moot point because BMScript
 * already comes with convenience constructors for all the major
 * scripting languages. Nevertheless, it nicely illustrates the bare minimum
 * needed to subclass BMScript. From a somewhat more realistic
 * and practical point of view, reasons to subclass BMScript may include:
 *
 * - You need to give your end-users the ability to supply script sources
 *   and want to employ much more robust error checking than the delegation
 *   system around BMScriptDelegateProtocol-p can provide to you.
 *
 * - You want to be able to also make use of NSTask's environment dictionary
 *   as this is currently unused by BMScript.
 *
 * - You want to initialize BMScript's ivars based on different criteria.
 *

 * 
 * This is the default way of using BMScript:
 * Initialize with the designated initializer and supply script and options
 * 
 * @include BlockingExecutionExamples1.m
 * 
 * Here are a couple of other examples of the blocking execution model:
 * 
 * @include BlockingExecutionExamples2.m
 * 
 * You can of course change the script source of an instance after the fact.
 * Normally NSTasks are one-shot (not for re-use), so it is convenient that
 * BMScript handles all the boilerplate setup for you in an opaque way.
 *
 * Any execution and its corresponding result are stored in the instance local
 * execution cache, also called its history.
