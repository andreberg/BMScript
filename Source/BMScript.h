 * @mainpage BMScript: Harness The Power Of Shell Scripts
 * <hr>
 * @par Introduction
 *
 * BMScript is an Objective-C class set to make it easier to utilize the
 * power and flexibility of a whole range of scripting languages that already
 * come with modern Macs. BMScript does not favor any particular scripting
 * language or UNIXâ„¢ command line tool for that matter, instead it was written
 * as an abstraction layer to NSTask, and as such supports any command line tool,
 * provided that it is available on the target system.
 *
 * @par Usage
 *
 * First off, to use BMScript in your own project, all you need to do is add the three
 * files that comprise BMScript:
 *
 * -# BMDefines.h
 * -# BMScript.h
 * -# BMScript.m
 *
 * Then BMScript can be used in in your own code one of two ways:
 *
 * -# Use it directly
 * -# Guided by the BMScriptLanguageProtocol, make a subclass from it
 *
 * The easiest way to use BMScript is, of course, to instantiate it directly:
 *
 * @include bmScriptCreationMethods.m
 *
 * You typically use the designated initializer for which you supply the script
 * source and task options yourself.<br>
 * The options dictionary then looks like this:
 *
 * @include bmScriptOptionsDictionary.m
 *
 * There's two constant keys. These are the only keys you need to define values for.
 * #BMScriptOptionsTaskLaunchPathKey stores the path to the tool's executable and
 * #BMScriptOptionsTaskArgumentsKey is a nil-terminated variable list of parameters
 * to be used as arguments to the task which will load and execute the tool found at
 * the launch path specified for the other key.
 *
 * It is very important to note that the script source string should <b>NOT</b> be
 * supplied in the array for the #BMScriptOptionsTaskArgumentsKey, as it will be added
 * later by the class after performing tests and delegation which could alter the script
 * in ways needed to safely execute it. This is in the delegate object's responsibility.
 *
 * A macro function called #BMSynthesizeOptions(path, args) is available to ease
 * the declaration of the options.<br>
 * Here is the definition:
 *
 * @include bmScriptSynthesizeOptions.m
 *
 * Notice how you must supply <b>at least two parameters</b> to the macro function. Supply an empty string for the arguments if you do not need to set any.
 *
 * If you initialize BMScript directly without specifying options and script source
 * (e.g. using <span class="sourcecode">[[BMScript alloc] init]</span>) the options
 * will default to <span class="sourcecode">BMSynthesizeOptions(\@&quot;/bin/echo&quot;, &quot;&quot;)</span> 
 * and the script source will default to <span class="sourcecode">\@&quot;&apos;&lt;script source placeholder&gt;&apos;&quot;</span>.
 *
 * <div class="box warning">
 *      <div class="table">
 *          <div class="row">
 *              <div class="label cell">Warning:</div>
 *              <div class="message cell">
 *                  If you let your end-users, the consumers of your application, supply the
 *                  script source without defining exact task options this can be very dangerous as anything
 *                  passed to <span class="sourcecode">/bin/echo</span> is not checked by default! This is a
 *                  good reason to use the BMScriptDelegateProtocol methods for error/security checking or to
 *                  subclass BMScript instead of using it directly.
 *              </div>
 *          </div>
 *      </div>
 *  </div>
 *
 * There are also convenience methods for the most common scripting languages, which have
 * their options set to OS default values:
 *
 * @include bmScriptConvenienceMethods.m
 *
 * As you can see loading scripts from source files is also supported, including a small
 * and lightweight template system. Before moving on to templates, though, it is important
 * to note that BMScript always expects any external data (files) to be in <b>UTF-8</b> encoding.
 * If you are unsure about the file's encoding, it is suggested to try to read in the file contents
 * yourself (using NSString API for example) and then use BMScript through its designated initializer 
 * to set the script source.
 *
 * @par Templates
 *
 * Using templates can be a good way to add domain-specific problem solving to a class.
 * To utilize the template system, three steps are required:
 *
 *   -# Initialize a BMScript instance with a template
 *   -# Saturate template with values ("fill in the blanks")
 *   -# Execute BMScript instance
 *
 * Here are the methods you use to saturate a BMScript template with values:
 *
 * @include bmScriptSaturateTemplate.m
 *
 * So how does a template look like then? We use standard text files which have special
 * token strings bound to get replaced. If you are familiar with Xcode text macros, the
 * magic token literals look like .xctxtmacro replacement tokens:
 *
 * @verbatim <##> @endverbatim
 *
 * If this pattern structure is empty (like shown) it will be replaced in the order of occurrence. 
 * The first two saturate methods are good for this.
 * If the magic tokens wrap other values, a more flexible dictionary based system can be used
 * with the third saturate method. There, the magic tokens must wrap names of keys defined in the
 * dictionary. The keys will correspond to what the replacement value will be. <br>
 *
 * Here is an example of a Ruby script template, which converts octal or hexadecimal values to their decimal representation:
 *
 * @include convertToDecimalTemplate.rb
 *
 * Here's a short example how you'd use keyword based templates:
 *
 * @include TemplateKeywordSaturationExample.m
 *
 * @note In BMScript v0.1 the magic token was equivalent to one form of Ruby's double qouted string literal: <span class="sourcecode">%{}</span>.
 * The idea behind this was that the concept should be somewhat familiar and easy to grasp. I have since changed this as it introduced too many 
 * back and forth escapings of the percent signs in order to be used as format strings, besides being generally confusing. 
 *
 * Instead I have decided to use Xcode's text macro tokens. 
 * There are two benefits to this:
 *
 *      -# No escaping necessary to use as format strings.
 *      -# Xcode shows them graphically in the source text as replacement values.
 *
 * If you want to change the magic token string to something else you can either change the #BMSCRIPT_TEMPLATE_TOKEN_START and #BMSCRIPT_TEMPLATE_TOKEN_END defines,
 * or, if you are using the dictionary based saturation method (BMScript#saturateTemplateWithDictionary:) you can set two keys in the dictionary which correspond to the defines
 * mentioned previously. The keys are #BMScriptTemplateTokenStartKey and #BMScriptTemplateTokenEndKey respectively.
 * 
 * I am also thinking about including an additional set of saturation methods which will allow you to pass in magic token start and end strings for the sequential saturation methods.
 * If there is demand for it I will try to include them in the next version.
 *
 * @par Subclassing BMScript
 *
 * You can also see BMScript as a sort of abstract superclass and customize its
 * behaviour by making a subclass which knows about the details of the particular
 * command line tool that you want to use. Your subclass must implement the
 * BMScriptLanguageProtocol. It only has one required and one optional method:
 *
 * @include bmScriptLanguageProtocol.m
 *
 * The first method should return default values, e.g. for launch path and task arguments,
 * which are sensible and specific to the command line tool your subclass wants to utilize.
 * Here you may again use #BMSynthesizeOptions(path, args) as the options dictionary has the
 * same format as shown above.
 *
 * The second (optional) method should provide a default script source containing commands to execute
 * by the command line tool. If you do not implement this method the script source will be set
 * to the default script source of BMScript (see above).
 *
 * If you subclass BMScript and do not use the designated initializer through which
 * you supply options and script source yourself, the BMScriptLanguageProtocol-p.defaultOptionsForLanguage
 * method will be called on your subclass. If it is missing an exception of type
 * #BMScriptLanguageProtocolMethodMissingException is thrown.
 *
 * @par Execution
 *
 * After you have obtained and configured a BMScript instance, you need to tell it to execute.
 * This can be done by telling it to excute synchroneously (blocking), <b>or</b> asynchroneously (non-blocking).
 * Note the <b>or</b>: you should not use the same BMScript instance for blocking and non-blocking execution
 * at the same time. It is far safer to use one BMScript instance for blocking and another for non-blocking
 * execution.
 *
 * @include bmScriptExecution.m
 *
 * Using the blocking execution model you can either pass a pointer to NSString where the result will be
 * written to (including NSError if needed), or just use plain BMScript.execute. 
 * This will return the script's ExecutionStatus, giving you an indication if the script was executed, 
 * if it is executing, if an exception was encountered or if it finished successfully.
 * You can then obtain the script execution result by accessing BMScript.result by calling <span class="sourcecode">lastResult</span>.
 *
 * The non-blocking execution model works by means of <a href="http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CocoaFundamentals/CommunicatingWithObjects/CommunicateWithObjects.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH7-SW7" class="external">notifications</a>.
 * You register your class as observer with the default notification center for a notification called
 * #BMScriptTaskDidEndNotification passing a selector to execute once the notification arrives. If you have
 * multiple BMScript instances you can also pass the instance you want to register the notification for as
 * the object paramater (see inline example below).
 *
 * Then you tell the BMScript instance to BMScript.executeInBackgroundAndNotify. When execution finishes and your
 * selector is called it will be passed an NSNotification object which encapsulates an NSDictionary with three keys:
 *
 * <div class="box hasRows noshadow">
 *      <div class="row odd firstRow">
 *          <span class="cell left firstCell">#BMScriptNotificationTaskResults</span>
 *          <span class="cell rightCell lastCell">contains the results returned by the execution.</span>
 *      </div>
 *      <div class="row even">
 *          <span class="cell left firstCell">#BMScriptNotificationTaskReturnValue</span>
 *          <span class="cell rightCell lastCell">contains the underlying task's exit code (aka return value)</span>
 *      </div>
 *      <div class="row odd">
 *          <span class="cell left firstCell">#BMScriptNotificationExecutionStatus</span>
 *          <span class="cell rightCell lastCell">contains the script's execution status</span>
 *      </div>
 * </div>
 *
 * To make that clearer here's an example with the relevant parts thrown together:
 *
 * @include NonBlockingExecutionExample.m
 *
 * It is important to note at this point that the underlying tasks and pipes for a blocking and non-blocking execution
 * are tracked by seperate instance variables. This was done to make re-using a blocking BMScript instance as non-blocking
 * safer and vice versa. While I said earlier you should use one BMScript instance for blocking and non-blocking execution
 * this meant not using the same instance for both models <b>at the same time</b>. It should be safe to use the same instance 
 * for the other execution model once it has finished and completed successfully.
 *
 * @par On The Topic Of Concurrency
 *
 * All access to global data, shared variables and mutable objects has been
 * locked with <a href="x-man-page://pthread" class="external">pthread_mutex_locks</a> <small>*</small>.
 * This is done by a macro wrapper which will avaluate to nothing if #BMSCRIPT_THREAD_AWARE is not <span class="sourcecode">1</span>.
 * #BMSCRIPT_THREAD_AWARE will also set #BM_ATOMIC to <span class="sourcecode">1</span> which will make all accessors atomic.
 * 
 * However, to make it clear: <b>currently BMScript is not classified as being thread-safe!</b>
 * 
 * Especially as there haven't been enough tests in a multi-threaded environment yet as to say much 
 * about BMScript's thread-safety status. 
 *
 * That doesn't mean that you can't use BMScript in a threaded application. It really depends on the usage.
 * Be very careful, though, about passing around a single BMScript instance from thread to thread and also restrict
 * shared access to one BMScript instance. BMScript was designed such that each instance can fully encapsulate
 * the behaviour and state it needs to do its thing.
 *
 * BMScript was also designed such that re-use is possible. Unfortunately this does not automatically mean it 
 * intrinsically promotes re-entrant code. 
 *
 * You are encouraged to look through the source code in order to determine how you may use BMScript safely in a threaded
 * application.
 *

 *
 * @par Delegate Methods
 *
 * BMScript also features a delegate protocol (BMScriptDelegateProtocol) providing instances posing as the delegate
 * with the opportunity to have a say in wether a script should get added or removed from the instance local history,
 * whether or not partialData should be appended to the final result for continuously executing background tasks
 * and also providing them with the power to change the resulting data, which is perfect for validation of end-user 
 * enterred data, or data coming from a command line interface that's historically manifold. Employing delegates allow
 * you to customize the behavior of BMScript instances without the need to make a domain-specific subclass. 
 *
 * As a general rule of thumb, methods starting with <span class="sourcecode">should...</span> will be passed some data 
 * for the delegate to inspect and validate and expect a BOOL in return. If the return value is YES, the operation continues 
 * (e.g. the history item is added to the instance local history). 
 *
 * Methods starting with <span class="sourcecode">will...</span> cannot stop the operation but they can modify the data 
 * passed in and the returned modified data is then used for the remainder of the operation.
 *
 * @include bmScriptDelegateMethods.m
 *
 * @par Instance Local Execution History
 *
 * And last but not least, BMScript features an execution cache, called its history. This works like the Shell history
 * in that it will keep script sources as well as the results of the execution of those sources.
 * To access the history you may use the following methods:
 *
 * @include bmScriptHistory.m
 *

/*!
 * @example SubclassingExample.m
 *
 * Example of subclassing BMScript.
 *
 * This subclass provides specifics about executing Ruby scripts.
 * Of course this example is a bit of a moot point because BMScript
 * already comes with convenience constructors for all the major
 * scripting languages. Nevertheless, it nicely illustrates the bare minimum
 * needed to subclass BMScript. From a somewhat more realistic
 * and practical point of view, reasons to subclass BMScript may include:
 *
 * - You need to give your end-users the ability to supply script sources
 *   and want to employ much more robust error checking than the delegation
 *   system around BMScriptDelegateProtocol-p can provide to you.
 *
 * - You want to be able to also make use of NSTask's environment dictionary
 *   as this is currently unused by BMScript.
 *
 * - You want to initialize BMScript's ivars based on different criteria.
 *
 */

/*!
 * @example BlockingExecutionExamples.m
 * Usage examples for the blocking execution model.
 * 
 * This is the default way of using BMScript:
 * Initialize with the designated initializer and supply script and options
 * 
 * @include BlockingExecutionExamples1.m
 * 
 * Another way of using the blocking execution model:
 * 
 * @include BlockingExecutionExamples2.m
 * 
 * You can of course change the script source of an instance after the fact.
 * Normally NSTasks are one-shot (not for re-use), so it is convenient that
 * BMScript handles all the boilerplate setup for you in an opaque way.
 *
 * @include BlockingExecutionExamples3.m
 *
 * Any execution and its corresponding result are stored in the instance local
 * execution cache, also called its history. Usage is pretty self explanatory. 
 * Take a look at BMScript#scriptSourceFromHistoryAtIndex: et al.
 * You can a script source from history by supplying an index or you can get the 
 * last one executed. Same goes for the execution results.
 * 
 * Currently the return values (exit codes) are not stored in the history. Might
 * be added at a later time, but for now you can just save the value returned by
 * BMScript#lastReturnValue in a variable of your own before you do anything else with your 
 * BMScript instance.

 * Escapes all occurrences according to the specified escape character mapping. If nil is passed for the mapping, by default #BMNSStringC99EscapeCharacterMapping is used as the mapping. 
 * The C99 mapping currently includes \\a (alert), \\b (backspace), \\f (form feed), \\n (newline), \\r (return), \\t (tab), \\v (vertical tab), \" (double quote) and \\ (backslash). 
 * The remaining sequences such as hexadecimal, octal and unicode notations need to be specified already escaped anyway when constructing the script source via NSStrings. 
 * Those sequences will then be escaped when the default escape character is transformed (the default escape character is the backslash character). If you read script sources from file, 
 * depending on the behaviour of NSString in how it treats escaped sequences when reading the file data in, you may have to specifically escape any unicode literals yourself. 
 * You can use #stringByEscapingUnicodeCharacters for this.
 * 
 * <i>Implementation note: before thinking about escape sequences and how to do the replacements some thought needs to be put in about what even needs escaping.
 * By this I do not mean what parts of a string do need escaping, but rather the angle we are coming from. i.e.: when utilizing Ruby scripts 
 * do we need to follow the conventions of the Ruby language for what needs escaping? My first instinct told me yes, but I have thought 
 * long and hard about this: actually the carrier for transporting those scripts sources around is after all an NSString. 
 * So regardless of what language we use for our sources, when feeding the script sources into Objective-C land we need to escape all entities 
 * that need escaping in an NSString literal. However, while the assumption may be correct, it is also somewhat of a moot point since any and all 
 * modern interpreted languages follow the C style for escape sequences anyway, as does Objective-C.</i>
