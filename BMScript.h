 * @mainpage BMScript: Harness The Power Of Shell Scripts
 * 
 * BMScript is an Objective-C class set to make it easier to utilize the
 * power and flexibility of a whole range of scripting languages that already
 * come with modern Macs. BMScript does not favor any particular scripting
 * language or UNIXâ„¢ command line tool for that matter, instead it was written
 * as an abstraction layer to NSTask, and as such supports any command line tool, 
 * provided that it is available on the target system.
 *
 * BMScript can be used in two ways:
 *
 * -# Use it directly
 * -# Guided by the BMScriptLanguageProtocol, subclass it
 * 
 * The easiest way to employ BMScript is, of course, using it directly:
 *
 * @include bmScriptCreationMethods.m
 *
 * You typically use the designated initializer for which you supply the script
 * source and script options yourself. 
 * 
 * The options dictionary then looks like this:
 *
 * @include bmScriptOptionsDictionary.m
 * 
 * There's two constant keys. These are the only keys you need to define values for.
 * #BMScriptOptionsTaskLaunchPathKey stores the path to the tool's executable and 
 * #BMScriptOptionsTaskArgumentsKey is a nil-terminated variadic list of parameters 
 * to be used as arguments.
 * 
 * It is very important to note that the script source string should <b>NOT</b> be 
 * supplied in the array for the #BMScriptOptionsTaskArgumentsKey, as it will be added 
 * later by the class after performing some tests and replacements.
 *
 * A macro function called #BMSynthesizeOptions(path, args) is available to ease 
 * the declaration of the options. 
 * 
 * Here is the definition:
 *
 * @include bmScriptSynthesizeOptions.m
 *
 * @attention Don't forget the <b><span class="stringliteral">nil</span></b> at the end even 
 * if you don't need to supply any task arguments.
 *
 * If you initialize BMScript directly without specifying options and script source 
 * (e.g. using <span class="stringliteral">[[BMScript alloc] init]</span>) the options
 * will default to <span class="stringliteral">BMSynthesizeOptions(@"/bin/sh", @"-c", nil)</span>
 * and the script source will default to <span class="stringliteral">@"echo '<script source placeholder>'"</span>.
 *
 * @attention If you let your end-users, the consumers of your application, supply the 
 * script source without defining exact task options this can be very dangerous as anything
 * passed to /bin/sh is not checked by default! This might be a good reason to subclass BMScript
 * instead of using it directly.
 *
 * There are also convenience methods for the most common scripting languages, which have
 * their options set to OS default values:
 *
 * @include bmScriptConvenienceMethods.m
 *
 * As you can see loading scripts from source files is also supported, including a small
 * and lightweight template system. 
 * 
 * @par Templates
 * 
 * Using templates can be a good way to add domain-specific problem solving to a class. 
 * To utilize the template system, three steps are required:
 *
 *   -# Initialize a BMScript instance with a template 
 *   -# Saturate template with values ("fill in the blanks")
 *   -# Execute BMScript instance 
 * 
 * Here are the methods you use to saturate a BMScript template with values:
 *
 * @include bmScriptSaturateTemplate.m
 *
 * So how does a template look like then? We use standard text files which have special
 * token strings bound to get replaced. If you are familiar with Ruby, the magic template token
 * looks a lot like Ruby's double quoted string literal: 
 * 
 * @verbatim %{} @endverbatim 
 * 
 * If this pattern structure is empty it will be replaced in the order of occurrence. The first 
 * two saturate methods are good for this. 
 * If the magic token wraps other values, a more flexible dictionary based system can be used
 * with the third saturate method. There, the magic token must wrap names of keys defined in the
 * dictionary which will correspond to what the replacement value will be. Here is an example of a
 * Ruby script template, which converts octal or hexadecimal values to their decimal representation:
 *
 * @include convertToDecimalTemplate.rb
 *
 * @par Subclassing BMScript
 *
 * You can also see BMScript as a sort of abstract superclass and customize its 
 * behaviour by making a subclass which knows about the details of the particular 
 * command line tool that you want to utilize. Your subclass must implement the 
 * BMScriptLanguageProtocol. It only has one required and one optional method:
 *
 * @include bmScriptLanguageProtocol.m
 *
 * The first method should return default values, e.g. for launch path and task arguments, 
 * which are sensible and specific to the command line tool your subclass wants to utilize.
 * Here you may again use #BMSynthesizeOptions(path, args) as the options dictionary has the
 * same format as shown above.
 *
 * The second (optional) method should provide a default script source containing commands to execute
 * by the command line tool. If you do not implement this method the script source will be set
 * to the default script source of BMScript (see above).
 *
 * If you subclass BMScript and do not use the designated initializer through which 
 * you supply options and script source yourself, the BMScriptLanguageProtocol-p.defaultOptionsForLanguage 
 * method will be called on your subclass. If it is missing an exception of type 
 * #BMScriptLanguageProtocolMethodMissingException is thrown.
 *
 * @par Execution
 *
 * After you have obtained and configured a BMScript instance, you need to tell it to execute.
 * This can be done by telling it to excute synchroneously (blocking), or asynchroneously (non-blocking):
 *
 * @include bmScriptExecution.m
 *
 * Using the blocking execution model you can either pass a pointer to NSString where the result will be
 * written to (including NSError if needed), or just use plain BMScript.execute followed by BMScript.lastResult.
 * 
 * The non-blocking execution model works by means of <a href="http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CocoaFundamentals/CommunicatingWithObjects/CommunicateWithObjects.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH7-SW7" class="code">notifications</a>.
 * You register your class as observer with the default notification center for a notification called 
 * #BMScriptTaskDidEndNotification passing a selector to execute once the notification arrives. If you have 
 * multiple BMScript instances you can also pass the instance you want to register the notification for as
 * the object paramater (see inline example below). 
 * 
 * Then you tell the BMScript instance to BMScript.executeInBackgroundAndNotify. When execution finishes and your
 * selector is called it will be passed an NSNotification object which encapsulates an NSDictionary with two keys:
 *
 * -# #BMScriptNotificationTaskResults              contains the results returned by the execution as NSString.
 * -# #BMScriptNotificationTaskTerminationStatus    contains the termination status (aka return/exit code)
 * 
 * To make that clearer here's an example with the relevant parts thrown together:
 *
 * @include bmScriptNotificationExample.m
 *
 * It is important to note at this point that the blocking and non-blocking tasks are tracked by seperate instance variables.
 * This was done to minimize the risk of race conditions when BMScript would be used in a multi-threaded environment. 
 *
 * @par On The Topic Of Concurrency
 * 
 * All access to global data, shared variables and mutable objects has been 
 * locked with <a href="x-man-page://pthread" class="code">pthread_mutex_locks</a> 
 * (in Xcode: right-click and choose "Open Link in Browser"). 
 * This is done by a macro wrapper which will avaluate to nothing if #BMSCRIPT_THREAD_SAFE is not 1. 
 * Note that there haven't been enough tests yet to say that BMScript is
 * thread-safe. It is likely to be thread-safe enough, but if that will be enough for your own application will 
 * unfortunately have to be tested by you. 
 *
 * @par Delegate Methods
 * 
 * BMScript also features a delegate protocol (BMScriptDelegateProtocol) providing descriptions for methods 
 * your subclass or another class posing as delegate can implement:
 * 
 * @include bmScriptDelegateMethods.m
 *
 * And last but not least, BMScript features an execution cache, called its history. This works like the Shell history
 * in that it will keep script sources as well as the results of the execution of those sources.
 * To access the history you may use the following methods:
 *
 * @include bmScriptHistory.m
 *
 * @example BMScriptExampleSubclassing.m
 * Example of subclassing BMScript. 
 * This subclass provides specifics about executing Ruby scripts. 
 * Of course this example is a bit of a moot point because BMScript 
 * already comes with convenience constructors for all the major 
 * scripting languages. Nevertheless, it nicely illustrates the bare minimum 
 * needed to subclass BMScript. From a somewhat more realistic 
 * and practical point of view, reasons to subclass BMScript may include:
 *
 * - You need to give your end-users the ability to supply script sources
 *   and want to implement much more robust error checking in order to do so.
 *
 * - You want to be able to also support NSTask's environment dictionary
 *   as this is currently not recognized by BMScript.
 *
 * - You want to initialize BMScript's ivars based on different criteria.
 * 
 * @example BMScriptExamples1.m
 * Assorted usage examples.
